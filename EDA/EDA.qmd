# 1. Introduction to Project

Our team's project focuses on "Analysis and Prediction of Resale Prices of HDB in Singapore." The objective is to utilize historical data (2013-2023) on the resale of HDB in Singapore to analyze the factors influencing resale prices and to forecast these prices using machine learning models.

## 1.1 Data Preparation

The data is sourced from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) dataset titled "[Resale Prices of HDB flats from 2012 to 2023.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syrahmadi/resale-hdb-flat-prices-2000-2022?resource=download)" Through collaborative efforts, our team has completed the data preparation phase. For further details, please visit: [link to data preparation](https://isss608-vaa-project-group7.netlify.app/data_preparation/data_preparation). Going forward, I will provide a brief overview of the cleaned dataset.

The following graph shows how we get a new data file from the kaggle dataset.

![](images/Datasets.png)

After the above step, we performed data inspection and cleaning, changed the data types of categorical variables, and removed duplicate rows. At the end of the data cleaning process, we saved the data file as ***resale_hdb.rds***. Now, let's take a brief look at the cleaned dataset.

```{r}
#Check the dataset
data <- read_rds("data/resale_hdb.rds")
glimpse(data)
```

From the above output, we can see that the dataset we are going to analyze contains 237,909 HDB resale records, including 11 variables. Among them, there are:

-   4 numerical variables: *floor_area_sqm, lease_commence_date, resale_price, remaining_lease*;

-   7 categorical variables*: month, town, flat_type, block, street_name, storey_range, flat_model.*

Let's see how many unique values in each variable.

```{r}
#Count unique values of each variable
unique_counts <- sapply(data, function(x) length(unique(x)))
data.frame(Unique_Values_Count = unique_counts)
```

Now, I will introduce the definitions of each variable to facilitate your understanding.

## 1.2 Objective of The Report

::: {style="background-color: #D6EAF8;    border-radius: 10px;    padding: 20px;"}
1.  This report will provide a detailed exposition of the following sections of the group project:
    -   Exploratory Data Analysis.
        -   Univariate analysis: aiming to assist users to understand the quantity and distribution of resale HDB properties through different variable.

        -   Bivariate analysis: aiming to assist users to understand the driving factors of the resale price through visualizations.
    -   Clustering.
2.  This report will offer UI design for each section in the Shiny App.

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

As above mentioned, this report will present Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through two approaches. See the graph below:

![](images/EDA%20workflow.png){fig-align="center" width="515"}

Univariate and bivariate are commonly used methods in EDA:

1.  **Univariate Analysis**: Univariate Analysis refers to analyzing individual variables. It focuses on the distribution, central tendency, and dispersion of single variables. Common methods for univariate analysis include descriptive statistics, histograms, and box plots. Through univariate analysis, we can understand the properties and characteristics of individual variables without considering the influence of other variables.

::: {style="background-color: #D6EAF8;    border-radius: 10px;    padding: 20px;"}
**The purpose of doing univariate analysis in this project is:**

to provide the frequencies and distributions of different variables (such as flat type, housing area, geographical location, etc.), enabling users to understand the resale market situation or popularity of their own HDB flat or second-hand HDB flats they are interested in purchasing on the resale market.
:::

2.  **Bivariate Analysis**: Bivariate Analysis involves analyzing the relationship between two variables. It explores the correlation, joint distribution, and trends between two variables. Common methods for bivariate analysis include scatter plots, correlation coefficient analysis, and bivariate regression. Bivariate analysis helps us explore the relationship between two variables and understand their interactions and effects.

::: {style="background-color: #D6EAF8;    border-radius: 10px;    padding: 20px;"}
**The purpose of doing bivariate analysis in this project is:**

to explore the relationship between resale price and other variables, helping users understand the driving factors of resale price.
:::

These methods are very useful in exploring our dataset, helping us understand the relationships, characteristics, and patterns of variables, and providing a foundation for further data analysis and modeling.

Based on the above approach, we have designed the user interface for the EDA section in the ShinyApp, as depicted in the following sketch:

![](images/Shiny_EDA.png){fig-align="center" width="366"}

Moving forward, let's delve into more detailed design for each approach.

## 2.1 Univariate Analysis

### 2.1.1 Preparation

First of all, let's identify variables suitable for univariate analysis and find appropriate charts for them. The following chart illustrates how I select suitable variables for univariate analysis and the optimal chart I will use to present to users.

![](images/Univariate.png){fig-align="center"}

### 2.1.2 Chart Creation

We can utilize different R packages to create different types of plots.

-   [`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), for line charts, histograms, and violin plots;

-   [`plotly`](https://plotly-r.com/), for making plots interactive.

Now, I will showcase examples of the source code for creating different types of charts.

::: panel-tabset
## Line-chart

```{r}
#Univariate Analysis: by month

# group data by month and count quantity for each month
data_summarized <- data %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(quantity = n())

# create plotly figure
fig <- plot_ly(data_summarized, x = ~month, y = ~quantity, type = "scatter", mode = "lines+markers",
               line = list(color = "blue", width = 0.3),
               marker = list(color = "red", size = 3))

# add range slider and customize layout
fig <- fig %>%
  layout(title = "Resale Quantity by Month (2013-2023)",
         xaxis = list(title = "Month in Year",
                      rangeslider = list(visible = TRUE),
                      tickformat = "%Y-%m",
                      tickangle = 60,
                      tickfont = list(size = 6)),
         yaxis = list(title = "Quantity",
                      tickmode = "linear",
                      tick0 = 0,
                      dtick = 500))

# display the plot
fig
```

## Histogram

```{r}
# Univariate Analysis: by town

# Sort the quantity of HDB resale transaction in different towns from high to low using fct_reorder.
data$town <- fct_reorder(data$town, data$town, function(x) -length(x))

# create a histogram by town
p3 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = town)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.5) +  # Changed geom_histogram to geom_bar
  labs(title = "Resale Quantity by town (2013-2023)", x = "town", y = "Quantity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6, angle = 60, vjust = 0.5)) 

ggplotly(p3)

```

## Violin Plot

```{r}
#Univariate Analysis: by remaining_lease

p3 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = "", y = remaining_lease)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = "blue") +
  geom_violin(fill = "forestgreen", color = "forestgreen", alpha = 0.3) +
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "point", shape = 18, size = 4, color = "red", position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +
  labs(title = "Violin Plot of Remaining Lease  (2013-2023) (Red dot: Mean Value)", y = "Remaining Lease", x="") 

ggplotly(p3)
```
:::

### 2.1.3 UI Design

In the Shiny app, we will design a feature where users can freely select a variable, view its visualization, and simultaneously see either the count summary or descriptive statistics of that variable.

The demo is as follows:

![](images/Univariate_shiny.png){fig-align="center" width="736"}

## 2.2 Bivariate Analysis

### 2.2.1 Preparation

First of all, let's identify variables suitable for univariate analysis and find appropriate charts for them. The following chart illustrates how I select suitable variables for univariate analysis and the optimal chart I will use to present to users.

![](images/Bivariate.png){fig-align="center"}

From the image above, it's apparent that "month" stands out as a unique variable becaue of its chart type . I will create a separate box for it to display the results in Shiny. Other variables can be represented using box plots, treemaps, and heatmaps. Below, I will illustrate the process of creating visualizations for "month", categorical variables, and numerical variables.

### 2.2.2 Chart Creation

We can utilize different R packages to create different types of plots.

-   [`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), for line charts, histograms, and density plots;

-   [`plotly`](https://plotly-r.com/), for making plots interactive.

Now, I will showcase examples of the source code for creating different types of charts.
