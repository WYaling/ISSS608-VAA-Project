    "text": "1. Project Overview\nIn Singapore, the real estate market has always been closely watched, with particular attention paid to the resale market of Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats. The price trends in the resale market not only affect residents’ lives but also have significant implications for real estate investors and government policymakers.\nAccording to data released by the HDB, resale flat prices rose by 4.8% in 2023, a growth rate much lower than the 10.4% increase in 2022. The changing trend may be attributed to multiple factors. Government policies such as supply pipeline strategies and cooling measures may have led to adjustments in market supply and demand, influencing fluctuations in resale flat prices. Additionally, homebuyers may be attracted to more housing options, such as Build-to-Order (BTO) flats, which could result in a shift in demand away from the resale market.\nDespite a gradual decrease in transaction volume in the resale market, HDB resale flat prices remain relatively resilient, with some properties even fetching seven-figure sums. Although competition from the BTO market is intensifying, the likelihood of a significant decrease in resale flat prices in the short term is low.\nTherefore, gaining a deeper understanding of the factors influencing HDB resale flat prices and predicting future price trends is essential for comprehending the dynamics of the real estate market and providing decision support to relevant stakeholders. This project aims to analyze the influencing factors in the resale market and utilize machine learning techniques to forecast price trends, offering reliable data and insights to stakeholders.\n\n\n2. Motivation Behind the Tasks\nThe motivation for this project stems from the critical role of the Singaporean real estate market in the broader economy, as well as the pressing need to understand the factors influencing Housing and Development Board (HDB) resale prices and predict future trends.\nFirstly, for potential homebuyers considering HDB flats, understanding the trends in resale prices is crucial for making informed purchasing decisions. By grasping market dynamics, buyers can better plan their investments and navigate the real estate market with confidence.\nSecondly, for current owners of HDB flats, understanding the factors affecting resale prices is essential for assessing the value of their properties. Whether contemplating selling their flats or seeking to understand their asset’s worth, accurate information on price trends is invaluable.\nThirdly, for real estate investors, including property developers and financial institutions, insights into HDB resale price movements can inform investment strategies. By identifying emerging trends and anticipating market shifts, investors can optimize their portfolios and maximize returns.\nMoreover, policymakers rely on comprehensive data and analysis to formulate effective housing policies that promote market stability and affordability. Understanding the drivers of resale price fluctuations is crucial for crafting policies that support sustainable growth and address housing needs across different segments of the population.\nOverall, by delving into the influential factors shaping HDB resale prices and developing predictive models to forecast price trends, this project aims to empower stakeholders with actionable insights, facilitate informed decision-making, and contribute to a more transparent and efficient real estate market in Singapore.\n\n\n3. Data Source\nTwo data sets will be used in this project:\n\n“resale-flat-prices-based-on-registration-date-from-jan-2010-to-Jan-2024.csv” is sourced from Kaggle.\n“Number_of_Sold_and_Rented_HDB_Residential_Units.csv” is sourced from DATA.GOV.SG.\n\nOverview of the datasets:"

    "text": "4.1 Influential Factors on HDB Resale Prices\nExploratory Data Analysis(EDA) via Data Visualization\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships within a dataset. Data visualization plays a significant role in EDA as it allows us to visually explore the data, identify trends, patterns, outliers, and relationships between variables. Here’s a general outline of the EDA process via data visualization for the provided dataset:\n\nData Cleaning and Preprocessing:\n\nHandle missing values: Check for missing values in each column and decide how to handle them (e.g., imputation, deletion).\nData type conversion: Ensure that data types are appropriate for analysis (e.g., converting categorical variables to categorical data type).\nCheck for duplicates: Identify and remove any duplicate records if present.\n\nUnivariate Analysis:\n\nunivariate analysis examines individual variables to understand their distributions. For numerical variables such as floor area, remaining lease, and resale price, histograms are useful to visualize their spread and skewness. Categorical variables like flat type and location can be analyzed using bar plots to show frequency counts.\n\nBivariate Analysis:\n\nScatter plots: Analyze the relationship between numerical variables like resale_price and floor_area_sqm or remaining_lease to understand if there’s any correlation.\nBox plots: Compare the distribution of resale_price across different categories like flat_type or location to identify any variations or outliers.\nHeatmaps or Correlation plots: Visualize the correlation matrix between numerical variables to identify correlations among them.\n\nPattern analysis \n\nTemporal analysis focuses on understanding trends over time. Time series plots can reveal patterns in resale prices over months, while heatmaps or line plots display variation across different time periods and locations.\nGeospatial analysis adds a spatial dimension to the exploration. Plotting resale prices on a map allows visualization of spatial distribution and identification of any regional patterns or clusters.\n\n\nThe dataset on resale flat prices based on registration date encompasses various factors that influence property resale prices. Given the complexity of the real estate market, which is subject to fluctuations influenced by factors such as economic conditions, location, and property characteristics, conducting sensitivity analysis through visualization is paramount. \nBy considering variables such as the trend in resale prices over time, the impact of location on prices, and potential outliers or influential data points, visualizing the dataset can facilitate the identification of key insights. This analysis may include examining the effects of market trends, government policies related to housing, and other socio-economic factors on resale prices. This approach enables informed decision-making for individuals considering property investment."
